## What is this

Users can read according to their own needs by different chapters.

## Basic

This chapter is based on the foundation of the Rust language.Unlike the official documentation itself, the basic chapter contains not only the way to install, uninstall, and update, but also the core commands in the lib folder. Such as `cargo`, `rustfmt`, `rustdoc`, etc.

A reader who works through this chapter will not only learn the basics of the Rust language, but also gain practical skills related to the toolchain and its ecosystem.
